			<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

			<p>
				Hi! My name is Christopher Calascione and I am a junior developer. Originally I studied philosophy while attending UNC-Chapel Hill and was a floor manager/bartender at a local restaurant. I began learning web development on my own about a year ago. In July I moved across the country to Portland, OR to complete an immersive web development course at Epicodus. During my course I focused on learning how to build web applications with PHP, JavaScript, and Drupal. This past November and December I was a Front-End QA Analyst Intern at Plus QA. I was responsible for testing web and mobile applications across many different browsers and mobile devices. Currently, I am looking for opportunities to use my extensive customer service and newly acquired web development skills. I am also constantly looking for new web technologies to learn and implement in my own projects!

			<h2 id="general-questions">General Questions</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>
					What do you hope to achieve through this internship?
					<p>
						I hope to continue to learn while making a contribution to the current work at New Kind. I recently finished an immersive web development course at Epicodus in Portland,OR along with an internship as a Front-End QA Analyst. I believe that this internship is a great opportunity for my to use the skills that I have learned and allow me to learn new skills while sharpening the old.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Are there particular skills or technologies you'd like to learn or work with?
					<p>
						I am definitely interested in continuing to develop my skills as a front-end developer. I've been learning AngularJS in my free time and would like to continue to learn how to properly use AngularJS as well as other popular JavaScript front-end frameworks. I would also like to advance my skills with CSS preprocessors.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					This internship will be a hybrid of 20% in-person and 80% remote, do you think you'll work well without regular support and oversight?
					<p>
						I've been doing a great deal of studying on my own and feel that I would be able to work well in this type of internship. The only problem that I seem to run into on my own is deciding what kind of project to start and which technology to learn. There is a wealth of information online and I sometimes have trouble deciding where to spend my time. I believe that with this internship I will have specific tasks to complete which will help to narrow my focus.
					</p>

		<section>
			<h2 id="design-questions">Design Questions</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>
					Explain how design and development intersect. What role do you see a developer playing in the design process?
					<p>
						I believe that design and development are completely connected. If the designer and the developer are not the same person, then they must be in constant communication and both agree on what they are working to achieve. The designer may come up with they layout and the look and feel of the website, but the developer has to be able to implement the design. I believe that the developer's job is to implement the design as accurately as possible but also communicate any limitations that may arise.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Describe how grids are useful, and how you generally go about using them, or implementing them.
					<p>
						Grids are useful for easily laying out content on a page. They are also great for building pages that are responsive. Generally I use the grid systems that come with front-end frameworks like Twitter Bootstrap. I have also had some exposure to creating a grid system from scratch from teamtreehouse.com. Currently, I am interested in learning how to use flexbox to see if it would be an easier tool for page layout.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Talk a little bit about pattern libraries and visual systems. What are they and how are they useful? Have you used them before?
					<p>
						To make development easier and more consistant pattern libraries are used to detail how elements should look and respond. I have not had experience with either pattern librarys or visual systems but I am always ready to learn a new way to make my web development projects easier to create and maintain.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

		<section>
			<h2 id="technical-questions">Technical Questions</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>
					Describe your experience developing for Wordpress. Go into detail, please.
					<p>
						I don't have any experience working with Wordpress but I am very interested in learning more about it since it powers so many sites on the web. In my course at Epicodus I studied the basics of another PHP based CMS, Drupal. I've been exposed to setting up simple Drupal sites along with some themeing and module development.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Is this your first time using version control? If not, tell us about other times you've used it, and which technologies.
					<p>
						Throughout my course at Epicodus I used git for all projects. I especially was happy to be using git the day the power went out in class, luckily right after I had pushed up to Github. I also enjoyed using git when working on larger group projects. It was difficult at first to grasp the idea of branching and merging other's work, but definitely lead to a more efficient workflow in the end. I hope to continue to increase my knowledge of git if given the opportunity to take part in your internship.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Do you have experience with CSS pre-processors? Which one do you prefer and why?
					<p>
						I've had limited experience in teaching myself how to use Sass and Compass. I've gone over some Treehouse videos on their usefullness but have yet to incorporate their use into a project. Learning how to use CSS pre-processors is one of the skills that I hope to gain from this internship.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					What is your comfort level with responsive design? Have you done any mobile-first projects before? Tell us about what you know.
					<p>
						I've mostly relied on front-end frameworks to help with making sites responsive. I'm also familiar with using media queries to hande responsive design. I would like to continue to learn how to focus on making my projects with a "mobile-first" mentality.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					What books or blogs do you like to read, people you follow on twitter, etc. to keep up with the latest trends in front-end development?
					<p>
						I've found a great deal of online resources to use throughout my journey of learning web development. I started with Learn Python the Hard Way, <a href="http://www.Codecademy.com">Codecademy.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.codeschool.com">CodeSchool.com</a>. After completing my course at Epicodus I still reference their <a href="http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com">course materials</a> that are freely available online along with extensive use of <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> courses and <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">FreeCodeCamp.com</a>. I've also gotten very good at googling for the information I need, as well as refering to official documenation for the technologies I am using.
					</p>
					<p>
						During my course at Epicodus, I also found it helpful to attend as many tech meetups as possible. Portland, OR seemed to have a never ending list of meetups that covered every language and technology imaginable. I regularly attended the AngularJS meetup along with a weekly Saturday morning meetup up for junior developers to work on personal projects and get help from more senior developers. I hope to find similar meetups now that I am back in North Carolina.
					</p>
					<p>
						I don't make a lot of use of twitter, but I do find myself going back to some of the same sites over and over again. I've spent a lot of time reading through <a href="https://toddmotto.com/">Todd Motto's site</a> because he has a number of posts on AngularJS and they chronical the best practices as the technology continues to evolve. I also constantly refer to <a href="http://www.css-tricks.com">CSS Tricks</a> anytime I have a question about CSS and need some guidance. Everyday I find a new site that is helpful or a new site that introduces me to the next thing I want to learn.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					What tools, frameworks, etc. do you enjoy using? Tell us why.
					<p>
						Recently I have really enjoyed using AngularJS and Firebase to build web applications. AngularJS is so quick and easy to set up and integrates well with Firebase. With AngularJS ... Firebase is a quick and easy NoSQL database that also can handle user authentication and application hosting.
					</p>
					<p>
						Currently I am trying to become a more well rounded full-stack JavaScript developer. I've been learning to use back-end technologies such as NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB. I like the idea of having complete control over the web applications that I make and being able to use the same language throughout my project.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Explain how HTML, CSS, and JS interact - what is each layer responsible for?
					<p>
						HTML provides the structure for the content of a web page. CSS provides the styling, the look and feel of the content on the page. CSS is also used for the layout of the content. JavaScript provides the behavior for elements on the webpage and handles user interaction.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Progressive enhancement or graceful degredation? Choose your side.
					<p>
						Progressive enhancement allows for a web applications base functionality to be built first and then incremnetally upgraded. This seems easier and more efficient than trying to build the final version of the application and then figuriing out what functionality needs to be removed for less modern browsers.
